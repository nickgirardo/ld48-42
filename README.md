# ld48-42

This is a game created for Ludum Dare Compo 42, a 48 hour solo game making competition (there is also a Jam which is 72 hours and teams are allowed).
For more information, visit their website [here](https://ldjam.com).
Each Ludum Dare has a theme, the theme for Ludum Dare 42 was "Running out of space"

You can play the game exactly as it was after 48 hours-- bugs and all-- [here](https://nickgirardo.github.io/game/index.html).
The final competition source state has also been preserved in the branch [ld42-final](https://github.com/nickgirardo/ld48-42/tree/ld42-final).

I intend to go forward with a few bug fixes and some minor balance tweaks to create a more realized experience.
No changes which I believe would not be in the spirit of the original game are planned (for instance new enemies or complications like power-ups).
I will of course leave the 48 hour version unchanged.

## Development

Running `npm run start:dev` starts an instance of the webpack-dev-server which allows you to run and work on the game quite easily.
